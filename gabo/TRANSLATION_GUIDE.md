# Translation System Implementation Guide

## What was implemented

### 1. Language Store (`/src/stores/language.js`)
- Uses Pinia for state management
- Supports Bulgarian (bg) and English (en)
- Automatically saves language preference to localStorage
- Has `t(key)` method for getting translations
- Toggle functionality between languages

### 2. Navigation Update (`/src/components/Navigation.vue`)
- Added toggle button with globe icon and language text (BG/EN)
- All navigation texts use translations
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Updated dropdown menus and mobile menu

### 3. Home Page Update (`/src/views/Home.vue`)
- Hero section uses translations
- Statistics section translated
- Features section with 4 features
- Pricing section with 3 plans
- Recent Activity section
- Time formatting based on language

### 4. App.vue Initialization
- Auto-loads saved language on startup
- Integration with auth store

## How it works

1. **Toggle button**: Navigation button switches between BG and EN
2. **Auto-save**: Selected language is saved to localStorage
3. **Reactivity**: All components update immediately on language change
4. **Fallback**: If key doesn't exist, shows the key itself

## Testing

Server is running on: http://localhost:5173

**How to test:**
1. Open the website
2. Click the BG/EN button in navigation
3. Watch all texts transform
4. Test on mobile device too

## Technical details

- **No i18n dependencies** - uses simple Pinia store
- **Fast performance** - all translations loaded in memory
- **Easy to extend** - add more keys to stores/language.js
- **TypeScript ready** - can easily migrate to TypeScript
